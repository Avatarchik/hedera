Unity Editor env art tool for procedurally generating 3D ivy meshes

### current state
this isn't usable, I was in the middle of fighting with Unity's shitty OnSceneGUI support... I can't get custom handles to draw for me at all, which makes painting and visualization very difficult. Someday I'll come back to this and fix it / seek revenge on Unity. But right now, it's very unusable / only 50% done.

### license
GPL2 (due to original author's use of GPL2)
- you can use the ivy assets / generated meshes and results, under any license, in commercial or closed source projects
- all code is editor-only and stripped upon build, which I think avoids GPL2's wrath
- (but I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice)
