Unity Editor env art tool for procedurally generating 3D ivy meshes

### current state
this isn't usable, I was in the middle of fighting with Unity's shitty OnSceneGUI support... I can't get custom handles to draw for me at all, which makes painting and visualization very difficult. Someday I'll come back to this and fix it / seek revenge on Unity. But right now, it's very unusable / only 50% done.

### license
GPL2, due to the original author's use of GPL2
- you can use the assets / results of this tool without triggering GPL2
- but if you include the code as part of your game, then you trigger GPL2
- for this reason, and many other reasons, this is designed as an editor-only tool to protect you from GPL2
